This Project implements a ancient machine called enignma machine, which was used by germans in world war 2.
This project uses enigma machine to encrypt a message, and uses it's fixed settings to decrypt the message.
The settings can be sent to others safely because we have implemented a symmetric key encryption to encrypt the settings of the machine.
With the machine settings with them, they can decrypt the message.
A minute part of this project even contains the implementation of OXO machine(ancient tic-tac-toe machine), and some information about the enigma machine and others.
